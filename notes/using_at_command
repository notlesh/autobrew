Notes:
	When testing a command using at, attempt something of the form:
		echo "whatever command" | at now

	at uses sh, which is really dash. dash sucks and doesn't understand simple things like "source".  So the commands below avoid the aliased brew commands.

Try this to schedule HLT the following morning:

echo "sudo ~/ab2/tools/pid_temp_controller/debug/pid_temp_controller --temp-probe 28.3aa87d040000
--pin-id 4 --safety-id 24 -s 80" | at 0500 tomorrow
